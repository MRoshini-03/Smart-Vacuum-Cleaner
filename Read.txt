This project aims to design and develop a cost-effective autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner using an Arduino-based system integrated with a mapping algorithm for efficient cleaning of hospital floor areas. The robot utilizes the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, which sends data to the Arduino UNO microcontroller to navigate and avoid obstacles, ensuring seamless and safe movement throughout the cleaning process. The key feature of this project is its emphasis on affordability and accessibility, making advanced cleaning technology available in environments that need it most, such as hospitals. Unlike traditional vacuum cleaners, this autonomous robot does not require manual operation, significantly reducing the workload of staff. Additionally, the robot incorporates voice recognition capabilities via Google Assistant, allowing users to control and activate the device through voice commands instead of conventional buttons or switches. This feature is particularly beneficial for visually impaired individuals, offering a user-friendly and inclusive approach to robotic cleaning. Overall, this innovative solution enhances cleaning efficiency, reduces human intervention, and provides a smarter and more accessible way to maintain hygiene in critical environments.

Working principle
     The working principle outlines the operational model of an Arduino-based autonomous robot vacuum cleaner designed for efficient floor cleaning. The process starts with the robot initiating Wi-Fi and Blynk connections, enabling remote control and monitoring. The user then selects a movement algorithm—either "Random Walk" or "Wall Follow"—which dictates the robot’s cleaning pattern. Upon activation via Google Assistant, the robot starts cleaning by powering the vacuum pump, collecting environmental data through sensors, and rotating its wheel motors. The robot continuously checks for obstacles in its path using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor; when an obstacle is detected, it adjusts its direction according to the selected movement algorithm to avoid collisions. The robot remains operational until it receives a shutdown command, either manually or via voice command, at which point the cleaning process concludes. This model demonstrates a user-friendly, low-cost solution for autonomous cleaning, emphasizing accessibility and efficiency in environments like hospitals.
